<title>External Communication with JS9</title>
<center><h3>External Communication with JS9</h3></center>

<p>
The JS9 <b>Analysis menu</b> provides flexible support for running a
macro-expanded external analysis command on the Web server and
displaying results in the browser. But there are other scenarios in which
it might be desirable for an external process to communicate with the
JS9 client:

<ul>
<li> JS9 might be part of a larger Web-based analysis system
(i.e. instead of the analysis being incorporated into the Analysis
menu). An analysis task might want to query JS9 for its regions.
<li> A Web site might offer "live" tutorials in which JS9 in the
browser is manipulated automatically from the server.
<li> A Web site might wish to modify a JS9 client's user interface based
on the level of expertise of a given user.
<li> A user running JS9 locally might want to interact with her JS9 client from within a local analysis script.
<li> A remote user might want to interact with her JS9 client in a similar way.
</ul>

<p>
If you run the Node.js-based helper (instead of the CGI helper), this
sort of external communication is supported by the <b>js9 script</b>
and its underlying <b>js9Msg.js</b>. The script runs
<b>Node.js</b> with js9Msg.js as its first argument. Using command
line syntax, it will send a single JS9 command to the browser and
return the results:
<pre>
  sh> js9 cmap heat        # change colormap to heat
  OK
  sh> js9 cmap             # return the current colormap
  heat
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, if no command-line arguments are specified, js9 will
enter a "read-line" loop, executing commands as they are input:
<pre>
  sh> js9 
  JS9> cmap heat
  OK
  JS9> cmap
  heat
</pre>
<p>
You also can send multiple commands to the script's standard input:
<pre>
  sh> cat test.reg
  region circle {"x":588, "y":590, "radius":30, "tags":"source"}
  region circle {"x":588, "y":590, "radius":10, "tags":"exclude"}
  region circle {"x":390, "y":430, "radius":50, "tags":"background"}
  region circle {"x":390, "y":430, "radius":10, "tags":"background,exclude"}
  sh> cat test.reg | js9    # send regions to JS9
</pre>
(Note: currently, redirecting to stdin does not appear to display
return messages. We'll fix this in a future release.)

<p> 
A list of available JS9 commands can be retrieved using the ''help' command:
<pre>
  sh> js9 help
  analysis     	run/list analysis for current image (ana)
  colormap     	set/get colormap for current image (cmap)
  colormaps    	get list of available colormaps (cmaps)
  help     	get list of available commands
  helper     	get/set helper connection
  image     	get name of currently loaded image or display specified image
  images     	get list of currently loaded images
  load     	load image(s)
  pan     	set/get pan location for current image
  pix2wcs     	get image pixel value for specified wcs position
  print     	print image window
  regions     	add region to current image or list all regions (reg, region)
  scale     	set/get scaling for current image
  scales     	get list of available scales
  url     	display a url
  wcssys     	set/get wcs system for current image
  wcsu     	set/get wcs units used for current image
  wcssystems   	get list of available wcs systems
  wcsunits     	get list of available wcs units
  wcs2pix     	get wcs position for specified image pixel
  zoom     	set/get zoom for current image
</pre>
These are the same commands that are available to the JS9 light-weight 
<b>Console</b> window.

<p>
One of the most important JS9 commands is the 'region' command, which
will create a new region or display the current region(s):
<pre>
  sh> js9 region circle
  OK
  sh> js9 regions
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Region-specific properties can be supplied in JSON format after the
shape is specified (see http://www.json.org/). You can pass any
property value found in the JS9.Regions.opts object. For example:
<pre>
  sh> js9 region circle '{"x":495, "y":495, "radius":25, "color":"yellow"}'
  OK
</pre>
<p>
The <b>js9 script</b> can talk to a JS9 instance if the script is run from:
<ul>
<li> the local host running the Web service and back-end helper
<li> the same host that is running the target browser, regardless of
where the helper resides
</ul>
Note that the <b>js9 script</b> on one host cannot communicate with a
target browser on another host (unless the first host is the helper host).
<p>
If a JS9 instance is connected to a helper on a remote host, you can
use the <b>-helper</b> switch to specify the remote host to
contact. For example, if the helper is running on js9.cfa.harvard.edu,
you can send a command to your instance of JS9 this way:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -helper js9.cfa.harvard.edu region circle
  OK
</pre>
<p>
If more than one instance of JS9 appears on a single Web page, the 
<b>-id</b> switch can differentiate between instances. The value of
the id switch is the div id for that JS9 instance.  For example, if
two instances of JS9 having div ids of "JS9" and "myJS9" are defined
on the same page, then js9 can communicate with the latter in this way:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -id myJS9 region circle
  OK
  sh> js9 -id myJS9 region 
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
or, from the readline loop:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -id myJS9
  JS9> region circle
  OK
  JS9> region -id myJS9
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Putting the last two techniques together, you can talk to one of many JS9
instances on a page connected to a remote helper this way:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -helper js9.cfa.harvard.edu -id myJS9 cmap heat
  OK
</pre>
<p>
A final esoteric note: special considerations are required when a helper
host wants to talk to one of several instances of JS9 connected to the
helper. Being on the same host as the helper, the <b>js9 script</b> is
allowed to send messages to any of these clients. But for security
reasons, it can only send a message to an individual browser, not to all
browsers at once. If the target browser's ip address is known,
the <b>-browser</b> switch can be used to differentiate browsers
running the same page. For example, if you want to talk to the JS9
client browser on bynars:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -browser bynars.cfa.harvard.edu -id myJS9 region circle
  OK
  sh> js9 -browser bynars.cfa.harvard.edu -id JS9 region 
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
or, from the readline loop:
<pre>
  sh> js9 -browser bynars.cfa.harvard.edu -id myJS9
  JS9> region circle
  OK
  JS9> region 
  ICRS; circle(23:23:26.929, +58:48:50.381, 14.76&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
The js9 interface will evolve to meet the needs of the astronomical
community.
