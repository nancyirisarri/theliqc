<p>
<h3>Getting Started with JS9</h3>
<p>
JS9 provides astronomical image display capabilities right in your browser. 
JS9 takes both its name and its core functionality from the de facto standard
DS9 image display program for desktop use, which is available at:
<pre>
    http://ds9.si.edu
</pre>
The JS9 display consists of one or more components that can be added
to a Web page by the Web page designer.  At a minimum, the JS9 display
will contain an image display canvas. It usually also will display a
menu strip containing several pull-down menus. Traditionally, this
menu strip is placed on top of the image canvas, but Web designers
have complete control over its placement. JS9 also can display an info
box, a command-line window, a pan window, a zoom window, as well as
other plugins. All of these windows can be brought up dynamically from
the View menu.

<p>
Astronomical image data usually is offered on a JS9 Web page as one or more
clickable URLs. When you click on a data URL, it is displayed on the JS9 image
canvas. Multiple images can be loaded into a single JS9 display. The <b>File</b>
menu allows you to switch between these images.

<p>
Once an image is loaded, you can move the mouse (or a single finger on
a touch screen) to display position and pixel value
information. Pressing the left mouse button and moving the mouse (or
using two fingers on a touch screen) will change the contrast/bias of
the displayed image, bringing image features into relief.

<p>
Menu options allow you to change the scaling algorithm and/or color
map, add geometric regions of interest, change world coordinate system
(WCS) parameters, and run site-specific astronomical analysis tasks on
the original FITS data.

<p>
<h3>JS9 Menus</h3>
<p>
The following menus are in the default JS9 menu bar. Note that Web
designers have control over which menus are displayed (or even whether
the menu bar itself is displayed). Thus, not all of the menus listed below
will be found on all Web pages:
<ul>

<li><p><b>File:</b> The File menu displays a list of all images
currently loaded into this instance of JS9. The displayed image is
marked with a star burst.  To display a different image, simply choose
it in the menu.  The menu contains an <b>open ...</b> options which
displays a file browser for loading FITS files (compressed or
uncompressed).  It also contains options to:
<ul>
<li><b>print ...</b> to print the current image display window
<li><b>display FITS header</b> for the current image
<li><b>display pageID</b>, a unique ID that can be used when
communicating with JS9 externally
<li><b>close image</b> to close the image and release browser resources
</ul>

<li><p><b>View:</b> The <b>display value/position</b> option specifies whether
image position and image pixel value is displayed as the mouse (or
finger) moves over the image. By default, this information is
displayed in the upper left of the image. You can redirect the display
to a movable, light-weight window by choosing the <b>InfoBox</b> menu
option. The <b>Console</b> menu option will bring up a movable, light-weight
console window into which JS9 commands can be entered.
The <b>Magnifier</b> menu option will bring up a movable,
light-weight window showing a blocked image of the data in an area
surrounding the mouse as it moves. The default magnification of four
can be changed using command buttons on the magnifier window.
The <b>Panner</b> menu option will bring up a movable,
light-weight panner window that displays the full image along with a
viewport rectangle showing the currently displayed image section in
the primary image window. The viewport can be moved around in order to pan
to different locations in the primary image. The panner also has
command button options to zoom the viewport itself. (This makes
the viewport rectangle larger at the expense of displaying only a
section of the full image. It is useful for panning in a very large
image.) 
<p>
In addition to these core options, the <b>View</b> menu also lists the
currently loaded <b>View Plugins</b>. JS9 itself supplies the following plugins:
<ul>
<li><b>Archive and Catalogs:</b> allows you to display image data retrieved 
from various archives and overlay catalog information
<li><b>Binning:</b> supports binning and column filtering on FITS binary tables
<li><b>Pixel Table:</b> displays an array of pixel values around the current mouse position
</ul>
<p>
Web developers can develop and register other plugins (which generally are
loaded into either the <b>View</b> or <b>Analysis</b> menus).

<li><p><b>Zoom:</b> The <b>zoomIn</b> and <b>zoomOut</b> menu options
zoom the primary image in or out by a factor of
two. The <b>zoomToFit</b> options calculates a zoom factor that fits
the entire image into the JS9 display.  You also can set the zoom
factor to a pre-specified value using menu options.  You can specify
any floating point zoom factor in the <b>numeric zoom value</b> text
box. The <b>pan to center</b> option pans to the center of the image, while
the <b>reset zoom/pan</b> sets the zoom to 1 and centers the display.

<li><p><b>Scale:</b>Each scale option specifies a different scaling
algorithm to use when converting image pixel values to RGB
values. (The procedure for doing this conversion is detailed in the
DS9 documentation titled "How It Works".) The log scale, for example,
is especially useful with X-ray data. The current scale is marked
with a star burst. 

<p>
You also can change the low and high values used to clip the image
data before scaling by changing the <b>low value for clipping</b>
and/or <b>high value for clipping</b> numbers. These values are set
initially with the data's min and max values or the z1,z2 values
calculated by the <b>IRAF zscale</b> algorithm (depending on the value
of the Web site's <b>JS9.imageOpts.scaleclipping</b> parameter. The
default usually is "dataminmax".). Finally, you can set (or reset) the
low and high values to data min,max or zscale z1,z2 using the <b>set
vals to data min/max</b> or <b>set vals to zscale z1/z2</b> options,
respectively. (Note that zscale requires a considerable amount of
memory and does not work on very large images. We will try to remove
this restriction in the future.)

<li><p><b>Colormap:</b> Each colormap option specifies a different
distribution of RGB values to use when converting image pixel values to RGB.
(The procedure for doing this conversion is detailed in the
DS9 documentation titled "How It Works".) Choose the colormap you like best,
or try different ones to see how data features can be brought to the fore
by color and contrast/bias.

<p>
You can enter a floating point value into the <b>contrast value</b> and 
<b>bias value</b> text boxes to set the contrast/bias. Note that the
contrast value ranges from 0 to 10 and the bias ranges from 0 to 1
(following DS9 conventions).

<p>
The <b>reset contrast/bias</b> option restores the original
contrast/bias value (which is especially useful if you changed the
contrast/bias or scale and now can't see any features at all!)

<p>
The <b>invert cmap</b> option inverts the colormap (e.g. in the gray map,
this will change white to black and vice versa). 

<p>
If you have three images of the same size, scale, and pointing
direction (e.g. three energy cuts of a Chandra data set), you can
display each one separately and assign to them one of the <b>red,
green, or blue</b> colormaps. If you then select the <b>RGB mode</b>
menu option, they will be displayed as one RGB composite image. The
current image (as shown in the <b>File</b> menu) determines which of
the three independent colormaps is changed by the contrast/bias
manipulation. To remove an image from the RGB composite, give it a
different colormap. Re-join (or add a new image) by assigning one of
the RGB colormaps. Simply turn off RGB mode to display the images
separately.

<li><p><b>Region:</b> Choose the appropriate menu option to create a
region of type <b>annulus</b>, <b>box</b>, <b>circle</b>, <b>ellipse</b>,
<b>point</b>, <b>polygon</b>, <b>text</b>.
(see below for details on how to use regions). One or more regions can
be created and manipulated on a single image.

<p>
The <b>listRegions</b> menu option will display all regions.
The <b>listOnChange</b> menu option will cause all regions to be listed
whenever one changes.The <b>deleteRegions</b> menu option will delete
all regions.  Note that each individual region has a configuration
menu (double-click inside the region) that supports
these options for that region only.

<li><p><b>WCS:</b> Use this menu option to select a world coordinate
system when displaying pixel positions and regions (assuming
the data file supports WCS). Available systems are: <b>FK4</b>, <b>FK5</b>,
<b>ICRS</b>, <b>galactic</b>, or <b>ecliptic</b>. The <b>native</b>
option chooses the system stored in the data file. The <b>image</b>
and <b>physical</b> systems will display only image coordinates (not
WCS coordinates). <b>Physical</b> coordinates are tied to the original
(block 1) file coordinates while <b>image</b> coordinates are tied to
the current image data being displayed. Server-side X-ray analysis
routines operating on the original file generally want physical coords
rather than image coords. Browser-based plugin routines generally use
image coordinates to operate on the in-memory image data.

<p>
You also can choose the units in which WCS information is displayed:
<b>degrees</b>, <b>radians</b>, or <b>sexagesimal</b>. Image and
physical coordinates are displayed in units of pixels.

<li><p><b>Analysis:</b> Each JS9 site can define server-side analysis
tasks to be run from the Analysis menu. Tasks are of two types:
<ul>
<li><b>immediate tasks:</b> These tasks are executed directly and
immediately from the Analysis menu. No parameter setup is needed.
<li><b>parameter tasks:</b> These tasks bring up a lightweight
parameter window allowing various parameters to be set before
executing the task. Parameter tasks are identified by the presence of
an ellipsis (...) after the task name.
</ul>
<p>
For example, the sample implementation of JS9 offers the following tasks:
<ul>
<li><b>Counts in Regions:</b> Run the funcnts program on the specified
source and background regions and return a text display (immediate task).
<li><b>Radial Profile:</b> Run the funcnts program on the specified
source and background regions and return a plot display. The source regions
consist of circles or annuli (immediate task).
<li><b>Energy Plot:</b> Create a histogram of the pi column of a
binary table and return a plot display (immediate task). The pi column
must exist in the data file (e.g., Chandra ACIS data but not Chandra
HRC data).
<li><b>Histogram Plot:</b> Create a histogram of the user-specified
column of a binary table and return a plot display (parameter
task). Parameters include: histogram column name, number of bins, use
bin width instead of bin size, and an option to normalize by bin
width. A help file is appended to the parameter display.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to server-side analysis, the <b>Analysis</b> menu lists
the currently loaded <b>Analysis Plugins</b>. JS9 itself supplies the
<b>Imexam</b> plugin, which offers the following tasks:
<ul>
<li>Encircled Energy
<li>Radial Proj
<li> Histogram
<li> Region Stats
<li> X Proj
<li> Y Proj
<li> 3dPlot
</ul>
<p>
Finally the <b>set data path ...</b> option allows you to specify a
colon-separated list of directories for JS9 to search when looking for
FITS data files that have been dropped onto the display. This is used
by JS9 when performing server-side data analysis on local
drag-and-drop FITS files. It is necessary to specify data paths
explicitly since Web pages are not allowed to determine the pathname
of such files automatically (for obvious security reasons).

<li><p><b>Help:</b> Show this and other JS9 help pages. The <b>Help</b> menu
also contains help for <b>Plugins</b>, including the <b>Imexam</b> plugins
listed above.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>JS9 Mouse Interaction</h3>
<p>
In keeping with the needs of mobile devices, JS9 utilizes a single
mouse button for user interaction. Keyboard input also is minimized.
Moving the mouse (or a single finger on a tablet) over the image will
display the position/value of individual pixels.  Pressing and moving
the mouse (or two fingers) will change the contrast and bias of the
image. A double-click (or double-tap) inside a region will bring up
the configuration menu for that region.

<p>
<h3>JS9 Regions</h3>
<p>
Regions are geometric shapes that can be used to mark part of an image
for analysis. JS9 allows you to create the following region
types: <b>annulus, box, circle, ellipse, point, polygon</b>.
A <b>text</b> region also can be created to annotate an image.  When one
of these options is selected, the region is created in the center of
the image. It then can be dragged to the desired location. Arrow keys
also will move the region one screen pixel in the specified direction.
A selected region can be deleted by pressing the <b>Delete</b> key (where
available. On a tablet, use the delete option in the configuration menu).
<p>
Click inside a region to select it and display the resize/rotate
controls around its perimeter. Grabbing a handle allows the size of
the region to be adjusted or rotated. In the case of the box and
ellipse regions, the width and height are controlled separately. Click
outside the region to de-select (or click another region to select
that one).

<p>
A double-click inside a region brings up a configuration menu. You can
change various values associated with a region by entering new values
in the appropriate text boxes and the clicking <b>Apply</b>.

<p>
The configuration menu has the following standard options:
<ul>
<li><b>id:</b> the id of this region, which can be used programmatically to select it for processing (read-only)
<li><b>type:</b> the type of region (read-only)
<li><b>image center:</b> new image pixel values can be entered to change the region position
<li><b>WCS center:</b> new WCS position values can be entered to change the region position (where WCS is available)
<li><b>Tags:</b> the default tags (<b>source, background, include, exclude</b>)
are used in X-ray astronomy but you can enter any string to tag this region and then select programmatically using tags
<li><b>WCS Region:</b> the WCS representation of this region, where applicable (read-only)
<li><b>Image Region:</b> the image representation of this region, where applicable (read-only)
<li><b>Options:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>List On Change:</b> list this region when it's moved or resized
<li><b>Fix in Place:</b> disable move and resize capability
<li><b>Delete:</b> delete this region. On an iPad, this currently is
the only way to delete a region.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, regions of different type support specific configuration
parameters in this menu.
<br>
The <b>annulus</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Radii:</b> change the radii of the region (in pixels)
</ul>
The <b>box</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Width:</b> change the width of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Height:</b> change the height of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>
The <b>circle</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Radius:</b> change the radius of the region (in pixels)
</ul>
The <b>ellipse</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Radii:</b> change the r1 and r2 radii of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>
The <b>polygon</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Points:</b> change the image points of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>
The <b>text</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Text:</b> change the text of the region
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Meta Key Accelerator</h3>
<p>
The <b>meta</b> key is the <b>Command</b> key on a Mac and the <b>Control</b>
key everywhere else.

<p>
When a keyboard is available, pressing the <b>meta</b> key while
clicking in the primary image window will pan the image so that the
clicked location is in the center of the display. 

<p>
The <b>meta</b> key also disables execution of plugin callbacks on
all mouse events. See <a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> for
more information about plugins and browser-based analysis.

<p>
Within a polygon, if you press <b>meta</b> and click the mouse on the
polygon border, a new point will be added at that point. If you press
the <b>meta</b> key and click on an existing point, it will be deleted.

<p>
<h3>Drag and Drop FITS Images</h3>
<p>
You can drag and drop FITS images and binary tables onto JS9 to
display the image data. All browser-based functions (scaling,
colormap, pan, zoom, regions, WCS) should work as expected. You can
run server-side analysis tasks on these data files if the back-end
server is on your local host machine. In this case, you must set your
DataPath variable in the Analysis menu to help JS9 locate the original 
data file.
