<h3>Adding JS9 to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
The sample js9basics.html file shows how to add JS9 to a Web page by
assigning JS9 CSS classes to "div" elements.  The js9multi.html Web
page goes further by showing how multiple instances of JS9 can be
added to a Web page using unique IDs.

<p>
To start, a few JavaScript and CSS files must be loaded into the Web
page.  Ordinarily this is done in the page's header, which typically
will look something like this:
<pre>
  <head>
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge;chrome=1" &gt; 
  &lt;link type="image/x-icon" rel="shortcut icon" href="./favicon.ico"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9support.css"&gt;
  &lt;link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="js9.css"&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9support.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="fitsy.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js9plugins.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
</pre>
Order is important: you must load js9support.min.js before you load
js9.min.js. You must load the plugin files after you load js9.min.js.
You can simply copy the order of files as specified in the JS9 demo files.

<p>
The text file <b>js9support.txt</b> is a list of the files contained
in js9support.css, js9support.js, js9support.min,js, and
js9plugins.js. Note that jquery v1.11.1 is one of the files loaded by
js9support.js. All of these files are contained in the js and css
sub-directories.

<p>
The <b>fitsy.js</b> and <b>js9.js</b> files (or their minified counterparts)
are loaded separately so that we can offer easy updates. as needed.
Fitsy.js contains basic FITS support and js9.js is the core JS9 module.

<p>
Instances of JS9 are placed on a Web page by assigning JS9 classes
to ordinary "div" elements. The two important JS9 classes are:
<ul>
<li><b>JS9:</b> this class will display the main JS9 image window
<li><b>JS9Menubar:</b> this class will display the JS9 menu bar
</ul>

<p>
You also can use these classes:
<ul>
<li><b>JS9Console:</b> this class will display a console window for executing
typed commands (very retro, but often quite useful!)
<li><b>JS9Info:</b> this class will display position, value, and
region information (patterned after DS9's display window). It's nicer
and more complete than the default display in the upper left of the
image, but takes up more screen real estate.
<li><b>JS9Magnifier:</b> this class will display the magnifier window
<li><b>JS9Panner:</b> this class will display panner window
</ul>
<p>
NB: all of these secondary windows can be displayed as light windows
using the appropriate <b>View</b> menu options. Light windows can
moved around on the page. Also note that if a window is declared
statically in a page, it will not be made available in the <b>View</b>
menu.

<p>
Placement of JS9 div elements should follow standard Web page rules
and constraints.  This means that div elements can be placed in any
order to create different graphical views. For example, the
js9basics.html page places the menubar above the image display, in
keeping with the traditional layout of DS9. The entire JS9 construct
is placed in a data cell of a table, next to a data cell containing
data URLs.

<p>
Multiple instances of JS9 can be added to a single Web page. This is done by
giving each JS9 div element a unique ID. In order to tie otherwise separate
JS9 components together, the IDs should be specified as follows:
<ul>
<li> start with a unique ID name, e.g. "myJS9".
<li> follow with an optional dash or underscore (not needed for the main window)
<li> finish with the type of JS9 element:
"Menubar", "Panner", "Magnifier" "Info", or "Console"
</ul>

<p> An example of how to define multiple instances of JS9 is found in
the js9multi.html file. Two DS9 instances are defined, having IDs of
"JS9" (the default) and "myJS9". When "myJS9" is the display ID,
"myJS9-Menubar" specifies the associated menu bar and "myJS9Console"
specifies the associated console.  

<p>
The ID is not required if there is only one JS9 instance on the page,
since it defaults to "JS9". However, if your site needs to communicate
with clients using the <b>js9 script</b> for external communication,
you can differentiate between clients loading the same JS9-enabled Web
page by supplying a unique ID when the JS9 page is served.

<p>
The js9.css file contains CSS directives for various parts of
JS9. These can be modified (or overwritten) as needed, subject to
ordinary CSS rules. In general, we recommend overwriting CSS rules by
loading a site-specific CSS file after the js9.css file. This makes
updating much easier.

<p>
<h3>One Menubar to Rule Them All</h3>
By default, each menubar controls one JS9 display. You can, however,
create a menubar that controls multiple displays, so that a given menu
selection is applied to each display. This is done by creating a
menubar div with two special characteristics:
<ul>
<li> the id of the menu bar starts with <b>_SUPERMENU</b> (it can end with anything)
<li> an HTML5 data attribute called <b>data-displays</b> lists the JS9 displays to control
</ul>
For example, to control two JS9 displays:
<pre>
  &lt;div class="JS9Menubar" id="_SUPERMENU_" data-displays="JS9,myJS9"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
As shown, the <b>data-displays</b> attribute is a comma-separated list
of JS9 display ids to control with this super-menu.
<p>
A super-menu acts like an ordinary menu, except that it will control
all of the JS9 displays in the list. Thus, you can change multiple
colormaps at once, run analysis on all displays, etc.
<p>
You still can define a menubar for each display in order to control
them individually. Since the actions of an ordinary menu and a
super-menu can be mixed for a given JS9 display, the displays will not
always be perfectly synchronized. In such a case, the super-menu's
selected values will be tied to the first display in the
<b>data-displays</b> list.  For example, if the first display listed
is at zoom 2 and the second is at zoom 4, the Zoom menu will show
a current zoom value of 2.
<p>
Finally, note that regions created with a super-menu are not tied to
one another across displays.  We will tie together events across
displays in a future release.

<p>
<h3>Adding Server-side Analysis Tasks to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
Server-side JS9 analysis tasks can be executed using
the <b>Analysis</b> menu, but they also can be executed directly from
the Web page using HTML elements (buttons, forms, etc.) To do this, a
Web page author simply creates the Web interface and calls
either <b>JS9.RunAnalysis()</b> (for buttons, menus, etc.)
or <b>JS9.SubmitAnalysis()</b> (for forms). These are described
in the <a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> web page.

<p>
<h3>Adding Local Analysis Tasks to Your Web Page</h3>
<p>
JS9 also supports the ability to perform local analysis, i.e.,
analysis tasks defined and executed right on your Web page, rather
than being executed by a back-end server.  This is accomplished by
offering access to the image data and region information via
a <b>public JS9 API</b>. See the
<a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> for more information.

<p>
<h3>Adding JS9 Display Windows Dynamically</h3>
<p>
JS9 display windows can be created dynamically using the JS9 Public API call
<b>JS9.LoadWindow()</b>. You can create a light window to hold a new
JS9 display on the same page or you can create an entirely separate
pop-up window. See the
<a href="publicapi.html">JS9 Public API</a> for more information.

<p>
<h3>Adding Data Files to a Web page</h3> 
<p>
Data file links are added to a Web page by supplying URLs that call
the <b>JS9.Load()</b> routine.
You also can load images automatically when the Web page loads using the
<b>JS9.Preload()</b> routine.
See:
<a href="yourdata.html">Adding Data Files To a Web Page</a> for more
information.
