<h3><center>JS9 Known Issues</center></h3>

<ol>
<li><b>All platforms, especially Chrome (June 21, 2014 : NOT resolved)</b>
<p>
Available memory can be a problem when loading very large gzip'ed FITS
files, especially in 32-bit Chrome. JS9 currently reads the entire
FITS file or gzip'ed file and inflates parts as needed. It can process
files up to approx. 200Mb in size before Chrome runs out of heap
space.  Note that Chrome often will load an ungzip'ed FITS file in
cases where the gzip'ed file fails (though there still are upper
limits on the total space available).  We hope that the 64-bit version
of Chrome (in early Canary release as of 7/1/2014) will alleviate
these problems. Otherwise, we will take a more drastic approach to
memory management within JS9 (at the expense of speed).

<li><b>All platforms (June 21, 2014 : NOT resolved)</b>
<p>
The zscale algorithm requires allocation of a fixed-size static memory
buffer. We have limited the size of this secondary buffer to be large
enough to handle a 4096 x 4096 x 4-byte image. If your image is larger
than this, zscale will not run. We will revisit the size of the
static buffer as we gain more experience with the size of images being
analyzed (or eventually rewrite the algorithm).

<li><b>All platforms (June 13, 2014 : NOT resolved)</b>
<p>
When resizing a box region in one direction only (i.e., width or
height), the width of the region's border will be different in each
direction.  This is due to the underlying graphics algorithm used to
resize the region, which changes the scale factor in each direction
individually and ties the border width to that scale factor. We will
fix this in a future release.

<li><b>All platforms using Chrome (March 27, 2014 : resolved)</b>
<p>
One of the simplest ways to use JS9 locally is by means of the file://
URL scheme, e.g., point your browser to file:///home/me/js9/js9basics.html.
<p>
This does not work in Google Chrome because Chrome does not permit a
local HTML file to read other local files. You can read a relatively
emotional argument about this restriction at:
<pre>
    https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=37586
</pre>
<p>
The workaround is to start Chrome with the 
--allow-file-access-from-files switch. On Linux:
<pre>
    chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>
On a Mac:
<pre>
    open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files
</pre>

<li><b>All platforms (May 20, 2013: resolved)</b>
<p>
If the "load image" command is part of a group of commands passed to
the js9 script, a race condition can occur when subsequent commands
are executed before the image is fully loaded. To avoid this problem,
images should be loaded in a separate js9 command and the load status
checked for completion before proceeding to manipulate the image.  See
the <b>js9load</b> script for details (or just use the script itself
to load images). (Technical details: images are loaded asynchronously,
so that other parts of the Web page are available during the load
process. A synchronous load could freeze the Web page while
loading. To avoid this situation, external processes should use the
"status load" command to check for a completed load before sending
further processing commands).
