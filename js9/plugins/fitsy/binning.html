<h3>Fits Binary Table Binning</h3>

The rows in a FITS binary table must be binned before being displayed
as an image.  By default, JS9 used a bin factor of 1 to extract the
central 1024 x 1024 section of the data for display.

<p>
The Binning plugin allows you to bin FITS binary table data in other
ways, by choosing the bin factor, the center and the image dimensions.
It also allows you to filter rows of the table by means of arithmetic
and boolean operations on the table columns.

<p>
When binning, you can set one or more of the following options:
<ul>
<li> <b>Bin Factor:</b> determines how many physical pixels are summed into
an image pixel.
<li> <b>Center:</b> the physical (i.e. file) coordinates around
which to perform the binning.
<li> <b>Dimensions:</b> the size of the image to display (i.e., the
size after binning is performed).
</ul>
<p>
For example, if a table has FITS (tlmin, tlmax) dimensions 4096 x 4096, then:
<ul>
<li> <b>bin: 4, dimensions: 1024 x 1024</b> will bin the entire file by 4 to
produce a 1024 x 1024 image.
<li> <b>bin: 2, dimensions: 1024 x 1024</b> will bin the central 2048 x 2048 
section of the image by 2 to produce a 1024 x 1024 image.
<li> <b>bin: 2, dimensions: 1024 x 1024, center: 1024, 1024</b> will bin the upper left
2048 x 2048 section of the image by 2 to produce a 1024 x 1024 image.
</ul> 

<p>
Table filtering allows you  to select rows from an FITS binary table
(e.g., an X-ray event list) by checking each row against an expression
involving the columns in the table. When a table is filtered, only
valid rows satisfying these expressions are used to make the image.

<p>
A filter expression consists of an arithmetic or logical operation
involving one or more column values from a table. Columns can be
compared to other columns or to numeric constants. Standard JavaScript
math functions can be applied to columns. JavaScript (or C) semantics
are used when constructing expressions, with the usual precedence and
associativity rules holding sway:
<pre>
  Operator                                Associativity
  --------                                -------------
  ()                                      left to right
  !  (bitwise not) - (unary minus)        right to left
  *  /                                    left to right
  +  -                                    left to right
  &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=                               left to right
  == !=                                   left to right
  &  (bitwise and)                        left to right
  ^  (bitwise exclusive or)               left to right
  |  (bitwise inclusive or)               left to right
  && (logical and)                        left to right
  || (logical or)                         left to right
  =                                       right to left
</pre>
For example, if energy and pha are columns in a table, 
then the following are valid expressions:
<pre>
  pha > 1
  energy == pha
  pha > 1 && energy <= 2
  Math.max(pha,energy)>=2.5
</pre>

<p>
In addition to the standard JavaScript/C syntax, filter expressions can make use of
IRAF-style <b>range lists</b> which specify a range of values. The
syntax requires that the column name be followed by an '=' sign, which
is followed by a range expression of the form:
<pre>
  col = :v            # col <= v in range
  col = v:            # col >= v in range
  col = v1:v2         # v1 <= col <= v2 in range
</pre>
The v values above must be numeric constants. 
<p>
[A note for DS9/funtools users: the DS9/funtools syntax supported a
comma operator, which I now consider to be one of the bigger design
mistakes of my career. The problem is that the operator either meant
logical AND or logical OR, depending on context. This led to a lot of
confusion. For JS9, the comma operator has been removed, so that you
now explicitly and clearly specify the logical operator:
<pre>
  pi=1:4 || pi=7:9    # equivalent to DS9's pi=1:4,7:9
  pi > 5 || pha > 6   # equivalent to DS9's pi > 5, pha > 6
  pi > 5 && pha > 6   # this had no comma equivalent and caused confusion!
</pre>
Hmmm ... I might have mixed up the last two examples. QED]

<p>
Once the desired parameters have been set, pressing the <b>Rebin</b>
button will filter, bin and display the data.
