<h3>How the interface works:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The green box 'Submissions in database:' shows what is stored in the database and is updated when clicking the submit buttons.</li>
  <li>The 'Submit good for Edinburgh' works separately from the issues. For example, a pointing can have calibration issues but still be marked as good for further processing by Edinburgh.</li>
  <li>The PSF tab has a table with the PSF statistics; ellipticity means and dispersions with absolute value >0.1 and 0.05, respectively, are marked in red.</li>
  <li>Field buttons are red to indicate it has not been inspected, while green indicates it has been inspected with or without issues.</li>
  <li>A field is considered inspected if submissions have been made for all tabs, that is, calibration, coadd, number counts, and psf.</li>
  <li>For now, after you make all these submissions, the colors and 'Submissions in database:' will only be updated if you refresh the page.</li>
  <li>Submitting non-checked checkboxes removes the previously stored value in the database. Submitting 'other' input replaces the previously stored value.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on the issues:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Satellite tracks remaining in the coadd prevent the data from going to Edinburgh!</li>
  <li>Fringing should be reported since the information is useful, but does not prevent the data from going to Edinburgh.</li>
  <li>As long as the astrometry dispersion is around 0.15", it should be flagged as ok. It will not compromise the quality of the catalogue,
  which is based on the stack, and lens for measures shapes based on individual exposures.</li>
  <li>If some plots are missing, they can be ignored. Possibly in the future the plots will be added.</li>
</ul>
